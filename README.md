# Task 11: Rooks on a Chessboard

## Problem Description

### Variant 11
The task is to find the number of ways to place K rooks on an N×N chessboard such that they do not attack each other. All rooks are considered identical.

### Input Data
The input file `INPUT.TXT` contains natural numbers N and K (N, K ≤ 8).

### Output Data
The output file `OUTPUT.TXT` should contain a single integer – the answer to the problem.

### Example
| №  | INPUT.TXT | OUTPUT.TXT |
|----|-----------|------------|
| 1  | 8 8       | 40320      |

## Instructions

1. Read the input values from `INPUT.TXT`.
2. Calculate the number of ways to place K rooks on an N×N chessboard such that they do not attack each other.
3. Write the result to `OUTPUT.TXT`.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input values are within the specified range (N, K ≤ 8).
- The solution should handle the maximum constraints efficiently.
